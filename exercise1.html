		<h1>Extraordinary Machine</h1>

			I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes<br>
			-And-<br>
			I certainly haven't been spreading myself around<br>
			I still only travel by foot and by foot, it's a slow climb,<br>
			But I'm good at being uncomfortable, so<br>
			I can't stop changing all the time<br>

			I notice that my opponent is always on the go<br>
			-And-<br>
			Won't go slow, so's not to focus, and I notice<br>
			He'll hitch a ride with any guide, as long as<br>
			They go fast from whence he came<br>
			- But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so<br>
			He can't stop staying exactly the same<br>

			If there was a better way to go then it would find me<br>
			I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me<br>
			Be kind to me, or treat me mean<br>
			I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine<br>

			I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day<br>
			You deem me due to clean my view and be at peace and lay<br>
			I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way, and say,<br>
			I've been getting along for long before you came into the play<br>

			I am the baby of the family, it happens, so<br>
			- Everybody cares and wears the sheeps' clothes<br>
			While they chaperone<br>
			Curious, you looking down your nose at me, while you appease<br>
			- Courteous, to try and help - but let me set your<br>
			Mind at ease<br>

			(Chorus)<br>

			-Do I so worry you, you need to hurry to my side?<br>
			-It's very kind<br>
			But it's to no avail; I don't want the bail<br>
			I promise you, everything will be just fine<br>

			If there was a better way to go then it would find me<br>
			I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me<br>
			Be kind to me, or treat me mean<br>
			I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine<br>
